# Task-scheduler-GUI - using GTK+

Task Scheduler GUI is a graphical user interface application for managing and scheduling tasks. It provides a user-friendly interface to input tasks with their priorities, burst times, and execute them using different scheduling algorithms.

## Features

Implements some Scheduling Algorithms, which includes,

1. Priority Scheduling: Allows scheduling tasks based on their priority levels. Higher priority tasks are executed first.
2. Shortest Job Next Scheduling: Executes tasks based on their burst times. Shorter tasks are executed first.
3. FIFO Scheduling: Executes tasks in the order they were added, following the First-In-First-Out principle.
4. Shortest Remaining Time Scheduling: Executes tasks based on their remaining burst times. Tasks with the shortest remaining time are executed first.


## Requirements
- C++ Compiler (e.g., GCC)
- GTK+ Library (version 3 or higher)
